# Tech-Blog

## Description
Being a techie means being in the know about all of the latest and greatest tech that is in development or about to hit the retail market. But how does a techie keep up with all of that information? A blog site of course! This blog site is meant for users to share any juicy tech information they can get their hands on. Users can create an account and start making posts and commenting on other blog posts.

The site is deployed at https://radiant-atoll-40954.herokuapp.com/

## Installation
To install the application simply clone the repository and install the dotenv, express, express-session, handlebars, mysql2, and sequelize dependencies.

## Usage
This is an open source project so feel free to use this to support your front-end site or use Insomnia to make a blog site of your own!
